       Installation Instructions for OpenFlow Reference Tests

This document describes how to install and execute the OpenFlow reference test
suite, which provides an automated way to verify that an OpenFlow switch 
adheres to the OpenFlow Protocol.  Out of the box, tests work with the OpenFlow
Reference Linux Switch, but can support other platforms by defining custom 
setup and teardown scripts.  Additional tests verify the reference learning 
Ethernet switch controller included with the OpenFlow Reference Linux Switch.

=== Prerequisites ===

The code has been tests on CentOS5.1 with dual quad-port Ethernet NICs,
connected by loopback cables.

Connect cables as:
 eth1 to eth5
 eth2 to eth6
 eth3 to eth7
 eth4 to eth8
 
It is not a requirement to have both cards in one system; passing the --common-setup and --common-teardown 
options enable a second system to act as the switch, using SSH with authorized keys.  
 
The instructions assume that the test system has an install of OpenFlow v0.2.1.

The following packages are required:
 perl-Convert-Binary-C
 perl-Data-HexDump 
 perl-Net-Pcap
 perl-Net-RawIP.i386
 perl-Error.noarch

These packages can be installed on CentOS 5.1 by doing: 
 yum -y install  perl-Convert-Binary-C perl-Data-HexDump 
 rpm -Uhv http://apt.sw.be/packages/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.3.6-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm
If it succeeds, do the following and you're done:
 yum -y install perl-Net-Pcap perl-Net-RawIP.i386 perl-Error.noarch
If it fails, the DAG package repository is probably down.  You past this with a copy by:
 wget ftp://fr2.rpmfind.net/linux/dag/redhat/el5/en/i386/dag/RPMS/rpmforge-release-0.3.6-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm
 rpm -Uhv rpmforge-release-0.3.6-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm
Since the repo is down, you still won't be able to download packages.  You can get around this by looking at a google cache of  the mirror list:
http://209.85.173.104/search?q=cache:I3Ha3zXve_QJ:apt.sw.be/redhat/el5/en/mirrors-rpmforge+http://apt.sw.be/redhat/el5/en/mirrors-rpmforge&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=iceweasel-a
...then installing the necessary packages individually 
 rpm -Uhv http://mirror.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/mirror/dag/redhat/el5/en/i386/dag/RPMS/perl-Net-Pcap-0.16-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm
 rpm -Uhv http://mirror.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/mirror/dag/redhat/el5/en/i386/dag/RPMS/perl-Net-RawIP-0.23-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm
 rpm -Uhv http://mirror.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/mirror/dag/redhat/el5/en/i386/dag/RPMS/perl-Error-0.17012-1.el5.rf.noarch.rpm
You can find the packages by looking at a working system and listing installed rpms in chron order:
 from rpm -qa --last | tac 
 
Alternately, these packages can be installed from source by downloading them from www.cpan.org.

After unzipping the tgz to create the openflow-tests dir, copy the environment variables file to your home directory: 
 cp openflow-test/scripts/env_vars ~/
Now change this file to match your setup (i.e. location of openflow repository).  Change OFT_ROOT to reference your home directory:
 vim env_vars
Enter a root shell session, or set up sudo. The perl-Net-RawIP library requires root access to bind to ports.
 su
Source the environment variables:
 source env_vars
Verify your setup by running regression tests:
 of_regress_test.pl
The test should show pass for all scripts.

To see more options for the regression script, type:
 of_regress_test.pl --help


== Writing Your Own Tests ==

Look at an example controller test:
 vim openflow-tests/projects/learning_switch/regress/test_unicast_unknown/run.pl
 
Look at an example black box switch test:
 vim openflow-tests/projects/black_box/regress/test_hello/run.pl

To run this test with all output printed:
 cd openflow-tests/projects/learning_switch/regress/test_unicast_unknown
 of_setup.pl; ./run.pl; of_teardown.pl

To see traffic when running a black box test, use tcpdump.  Secchan and the Perl code use the loopback interface to communicate, and you can snoop on this:
 tcpdump -X -i lo -s 256

It can be convenient to run you test in isolation, without setup and teardown automatically called.  To set up the OF kmod and interfaces, run:
 of_setup.pl

To remove the OF kmod cleanly, run:
 of_teardown.pl
Note that the kmod refuses removal until the interfaces and datapaths have been removed.
